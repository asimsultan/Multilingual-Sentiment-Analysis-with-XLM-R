# Multilingual Sentiment Analysis with XLM-R

Welcome to the Multilingual Sentiment Analysis with XLM-R project! This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis across multiple languages using the XLM-R model.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis involves classifying text into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we leverage XLM-R to perform sentiment analysis using a multilingual dataset.

## Dataset

For this project, we will use a custom dataset of text samples and their sentiment labels. You can create your own dataset and place it in the `data/multilingual_sentiment_data.csv` file.

## Project Overview

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Datasets
- Pandas

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/asimsultan/multilingual_sentiment_analysis_xlm_r.git
cd multilingual_sentiment_analysis_xlm_r

# Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure your data includes text samples and their sentiment labels. Place these files in the data/ directory.
# The data should be in a CSV file with two columns: text and label.

# To fine-tune the XLM-R model for sentiment analysis, run the following command:
python scripts/train.py --data_path data/multilingual_sentiment_data.csv

# To evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model, run:
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path models/ --data_path data/multilingual_sentiment_data.csv
